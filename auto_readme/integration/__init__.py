"""
Automation integrations for auto-research-readme.

This module provides integration classes for various services (GitHub, Zenodo, PyPI)
that can automatically set up workflows and metadata files for research projects.

The integration system uses a plugin-based architecture where each integration
is auto-discovered and applied based on the project configuration.
